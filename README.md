# predict_podcast_listening
## Predict how long users listen to podcast episodes based on episode features.

Project Overview:  

This project focuses on predicting podcast listening time using a combination of content, popularity, and contextual factors. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features, such as episode length, number of ads, publication time, and host/guest popularity.  

Our goal was to design, train, and evaluate predictive models that estimate how long users listen to podcast episodes based on available data. To accomplish this, we cleaned and processed the raw dataset, engineered meaningful features, and trained multiple models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost.  

By comparing performance metrics, we identified which model provided the most accurate and generalizable predictions for podcast listening time.
